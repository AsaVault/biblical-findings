	<h3>Biblical Findings</h3>
	<p class="horizontal">
	 	Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
	</p>

	<p class="vertical">Jesus has just clearly shown God’s righteous standard; perhaps He anticipated the thought “Wouldn’t everybody be impressed if I was like that?” So here Jesus addressed the danger of cultivating an image of righteousness. It is almost impossible to do spiritual things in front of others without thinking what their opinion is of us as we do those things, and how they are thinking better or worse of us as we do what we do.
	This does not contradict His previous command to let your light so shine before men (Matthew 5:16). Although Christians are to be seen doing good works, they must not do good works simply to be seen.
	</p>

	<p class="horizontal">
		Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites 	do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		There aren’t good examples in ancient literature of people actually announcing their giving with the sound of a trumpet. It may be what Jesus had in mind was the gifts given during feast times, which were signaled by the blast of a trumpet. “These occasions afforded golden opportunities for ostentation.” (Carson)
	</p>

	<p class="horizontal">
		But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		Such performers are rightly called hypocrites, because they are actors, acting the part of pious, holy people when they are not. It is not having a standard that makes someone a hypocrite; it is falsely claiming to live by that standard when you in fact do not, or when you have a double standard that makes one a hypocrite.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		Jesus tells the one who gives so he can hear the applause of others that he should enjoy the applause, because that will be all the reward that he will receive. There will be no reward in heaven for the one who did it for the motive of an earthly reward.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		Instead, our giving is to be – if it were possible – even hidden from ourselves. Though we cannot really be ignorant about our own giving, we can deny ourselves any indulgent self-congratulation.
		Jesus pointed out the great value of doing good deeds for the glory of God. It is much better to receive our return from God, who rewards much more generously and much more openly than men do.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		Jesus assumed that His disciples would give, so He told them the right way to give (Matthew 6:1-4). He also assumed that His disciples would pray, and it was important that they not pray in the same manner as the hypocrites.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		These hypocrites prayed not to be heard by God, but to be seen by men. This is a common fault in public prayer today, when people pray to impress or teach others instead of genuinely pouring out their hearts before God.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		Again, those praying to be seen of men have their reward, and they should enjoy it in full – because that is all they will receive. There is no reward in heaven for such prayers.
		The right kind of prayer does not use vain repetitions, which is any and all prayer which is mostly words and no meaning; all lips and no mind or heart.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		This must be the rule of our life when ordering our priorities. Yet it is wrong to think that this is just another priority to fit onto our list of priorities – and to put at the top. Instead, in everything we do, we seek first the kingdom of God.
		If you put God’s kingdom first, and do not think that your physical well-being is a worthy object to live your life for, you then may enjoy all these things. He promises heavenly treasure, rest in divine provision, and fulfillment of God’s highest purpose for man – fellowship with Him, and being part of His kingdom.
	</p>
	<p class="horizontal">
		Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
	</p>
	<p class="vertical">
		If you must worry, worry only for the things of today. Most of our worry is over things that we have absolutely no control over anyway, and is therefore foolish as well as harmful.
		Jesus reminds us of the importance of living for the present day. It isn’t wrong to remember the past or plan for the future; to some degree both of those are good. Yet it is easy to become too focused on either the past or the future and to let the day and its own trouble be ignored. God wants us to remember the past, plan for the future, but live in the present.
